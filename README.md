# Amazon-order-analysis

This project provides an analysis of how much money has been spent on Amazon purchases using Jupyter Notebook. Amazon purchases data can be acquired from the amazon account. The purpose of this analysis is to identify the purchase patterns and try to minimize and make conscious purchases to reduce expenditure and therefore increase personal savings.

Business Questions: The following are the business questions posed for my analysis.
1.	What is the total amount spent on amazon?
2.	What is the minimum, maximum, average expenditure?
3.	How is the money spent over time (by month)?
4.	Does day of the week effect expenditure?
5.	How much money has been paid in sales tax?
